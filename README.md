➡️The main advantage is the hidden installation and launch of files, without unnecessary noise and notifications. The ability to simultaneously launch pacifiers in parallel with your software (any PDF, Word, etc.), ensuring maximum secrecy of your actions.

➡️Black Messa Dropper effectively bypasses antivirus and any EDR solutions.

➡️Non-resident Loader + Panel, the ability to build in zip,msi,exe. Does not need an EV signature to bypass the smart screen. It doesn't need a script. 

➡️The build is built with your hands and fits to the panel ( press 2 buttons and replace 2 texts) + Installation and configuration manual. A solution for Google ADS, Bing, etc.

It is also convenient to change the build on the fly from the admin panel, I will attach everything with screenshots. Added Api Key protection, you can cut down the build on the fly.The API key of the panel, without a key, will not let you into the panel for logging into the system.
